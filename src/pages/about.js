        I love programming with Javascript, React and Next.js, regardless of
        whether it's a web application, a mobile app or an open source library.

        I spend my free time watching movies with my wife, Jamila, doing some
        exercise or reading a book (usually an investing book). At the moment,
        my wife and I live in Brasilia, Brazil, and have no kids (yet).
